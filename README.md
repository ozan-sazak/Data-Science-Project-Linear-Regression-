# Data-Science-Project-Linear-Regression-
## Laptop Price Prediction

### Project Information:
We have an excel file that contains 238 laptop data as technical features and price of the laptop.
We want to build a regression model that predicts price of a laptop by considering laptop's features.

### Methodology
#### STAGE 1: Collecting, and Preparing the Data
The data was obtained by reading the excel file we have, and obtained dataframe is adjusted to be able to apply data wrangling.

#### STAGE 2: Data Wrangling
The missing values is handled.

#### STAGE 3: EDA and Feature Engineering
Exploratory data analysis was performed using visualizations, and feature engineering was applied according to EDA conclusions.

#### STAGE 4: Modelling
Different Regression models was built to ensure the best results.
